"use strict"; //treat all js code as newer version
// alert("hello"); we can not use alert as it this since its nodejs not browser

console.log(3+3); console.log("hii")// not readeable not good practice

let name = "zeet" //string
let age = 32      //number
let isLoggedIn = false    //boolean

//null => standalone value
//undefined => value not assined
//null is a value itself, is something that is not undefined  its empty
// Symbols => unique , to define uniqueness

//objects 
console.log(typeof age); //opt = number
console.log(typeof null); //opt = object
console.log(typeof undefined);// opt = undefined
